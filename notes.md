Hereâ€™s a curated list of **useful commands** that cover the essentials for working with **Kubernetes** and **Docker**, based on our chat:

---

### **Kubernetes Commands**

#### General Cluster Operations
- Start Minikube:
  ```bash
  minikube start
  ```
- Enable Kubernetes addons:
  ```bash
  minikube addons enable metrics-server
  ```
- View cluster status:
  ```bash
  kubectl cluster-info
  ```
- View node resources:
  ```bash
  kubectl top nodes
  ```

---

#### Managing Pods, Deployments, and Services
- Create or update a resource from YAML:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f <file.yaml>
  ```
- Delete a resource:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete -f <file.yaml>
  ```
- Get a list of pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  ```
- Get detailed pod information:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
  ```
- View logs of a specific pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs <pod-name>
  ```
- Watch for changes in pod status:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -w
  ```

---

#### Services and Load Balancing
- List services in the cluster:
  ```bash
  kubectl get services
  ```
- Expose a deployment as a service:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment <deployment-name> --type=LoadBalancer --port=80
  ```
- Access a service via Minikube:
  ```bash
  minikube service <service-name>
  ```
- Get the external IP of a service:
  ```bash
  kubectl get service <service-name>
  ```

---

#### Autoscaling and Monitoring
- Get HPA information:
  ```bash
  kubectl get hpa
  ```
- Watch HPA metrics:
  ```bash
  kubectl get hpa -w
  ```
- Describe HPA:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe hpa <hpa-name>
  ```
- Get pod-level resource usage:
  ```bash
  kubectl top pods
  ```

---

#### Debugging and Troubleshooting
- View cluster events:
  ```bash
  kubectl get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'
  ```
- Get detailed information about a failing pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
  ```
- Force delete a pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete pod <pod-name> --force --grace-period=0
  ```

---

### **Docker Commands**

#### Building and Managing Images
- Build a Docker image:
  ```bash
  docker build -t <image-name>:<tag> .
  ```
- List local Docker images:
  ```bash
  docker images
  ```
- Tag a Docker image:
  ```bash
  docker tag <image-id> <repository>/<image-name>:<tag>
  ```
- Push an image to a repository:
  ```bash
  docker push <repository>/<image-name>:<tag>
  ```

---

#### Running and Managing Containers
- Run a container locally:
  ```bash
  docker run -p 80:80 <image-name>
  ```
- List running containers:
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
- Stop a running container:
  ```bash
  docker stop <container-id>
  ```
- Remove a container:
  ```bash
  docker rm <container-id>
  ```

---

#### Debugging Containers
- View logs of a running container:
  ```bash
  docker logs <container-id>
  ```
- Run a shell inside a container:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/bash
  ```

---

### **Benchmarking and Traffic Testing**

#### With `hey`:
- Generate high-traffic requests:
  ```bash
  hey -n 100000 -c 1000 http://<service-url>
  ```

#### With `wrk`:
- Simulate sustained traffic:
  ```bash
  wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://<service-url>
  ```

---

### **Combining Kubernetes and Docker**
- Check which Docker is used by Minikube:
  ```bash
  minikube docker-env
  ```
- Use Minikube's Docker for building images:
  ```bash
  eval $(minikube docker-env)
  ```
- Build a Docker image directly for Minikube:
  ```bash
  docker build -t <image-name>:<tag> .
  ```
- Apply deployment with a locally built image:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f <deployment.yaml>
  ```
